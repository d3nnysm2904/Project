Identify and use the core data types of JavaScript
Use all the different ways to declare and assign variables
Explain why JavaScript is called a dynamically-typed and weakly-typed language
Use your understanding of Numbers and Strings to get started coding!
What Are Data Types?
In any programming language, you have to distinguish between different kinds of data
For example, in English we might say that 1 is a number, whereas “one” is a word.
Programming languages define separate data structures which are built-in representations for types.
Primitives
String (‘hello’)
Number (3.141592)
Boolean (false)
Undefined (undefined)
Null (null)
Numbers
The number primitive in JavaScript is different than in other languages, because it supports both integers and floating-point (decimal) numbers by default.

let anInteger = 9000;

let floatingPointNumber = 2.71828;
The number constructor function is written as Number(). You can convert strings to numbers using it, or + for shorthand.

let nine = '9';
typeof nine; // string

// with number constructor
typeof Number(nine); // number

// shorthand with +
typeof +nine; // number
Number Methods
There are a handful of useful methods to remember on the Number function, in addition to Number.isNaN().

Number.isInteger() returns true or false
Number.parseInt() takes an integer out of a string or float, non-numeric trailing characters ignored
Number.parseFloat() takes a float value out of a string, non-numeric trailing characters ignored.
Number.isInteger('15'); // false
Number.isInteger(1.234); // false
Number.isInteger(15); // true
Number.parseInt('15'); // 15
Number.parseInt(3.14); // 3
Number.parseFloat('4.65xyz'); // 4.65
Numeric Operators
In JavaScript, there are many additional operators, and we’ve already seen some ( = assignment, == equality, === strict equality ).

+ Addition 10 + 5 === 15
- Subtraction 17 - -5 === 22
* Multiplication 10 * 10 === 100
/ Division (floating-point) 5 / 4 === 1.25
% Remainder after dividing left number by right number. (Sometimes called modulo) 16 % 5 === 1 (returns 1 because 5 goes into 15 cleanly, then 1 remaining)
** Exponent (power) 5 ** 2 === 25
Operator Precedence
Do you remember PEMDAS from primary / secondary school?

That order of precedence applies to JavaScript!

P Parentheses (Please)
E Exponents (Excuse)
M Multiplication (My)
D Division (Dear)
A Addition (Aunt)
S Subtraction (Sally)
NaN
A big frustration with JavaScript can be NaN (Not a Number).

NaN is a special value; the result of a failed conversion (or type coercion) to number.

let oldNan = Number('winter is coming'); // NaN

let sillyDivision = 5 / 'tofu'; // NaN
Variables
Variables are just containers that hold data types for us.
In JavaScript, variables are declared with special keywords: var, let, or const.
We’re going to be using let and const exclusively, it’s very rare that you will need var anymore.
We’ll be covering the differences in far more detail later on!
let myName = 'Colt Steele';
let myAge = 87;
let cool;  // we say 'cool' is declared but not assigned a value
Then they are assigned a value with the single equals sign:

cool = false;  // cool is assigned (previously was undefined)
Variable Naming Conventions
Most variables in JavaScript are lowerCamelCase.

let thisIsLowerCamelCase = true;
Constants might be represented as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

const AVOGADROS_CONSTANT =  6.022140857 * 10 ** 23;
Variables Can Change Type
If you declare a variable, the default value is undefined.

let cat;
typeof cat; // undefined
cat = 'Scout';
typeof cat; // string
cat = true;
typeof cat; // boolean
cat = 1.57
typeof cat; // number
Then you can re-assign the variable as many times as you want*.

We’ll talk about the one exception to this soon!

Variables Can not be redeclared
If you use let or const, you can not redeclare variables

let firstName = "Tamara";

let firstName = "Tamara"; // Error!

const numberOfStates = 50

const numberOfStates = 51 // Error!
With const, variables can not be reassigned
The biggest difference with let and const is assignment and declaration.

let firstName = "Tamara";

firstName = "Isadore"; // works fine!

const numberOfStates = 50

numberOfStates = 51 // Error!
Comparison of Variable Declaration Keywords
Keyword	Can Reassign	Can Redeclare
var	yes	yes
let	yes	no
const	no	no
What about var?
There’s really no need to use it
