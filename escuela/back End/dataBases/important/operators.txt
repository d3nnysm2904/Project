SQL Operators 

Operators are used to build more complicated queries 
they involve reserved keywords 

These include
 IN
 NOT IN 
 BETWEEN 
 AND 
 OR 


 LIKE (is case sensitive )
 ( A PERCENT SIGN % MATCHES ANY SEQUENCE OF ZERO OR MORE CHARACTERS, ANYTING WILL MATCH AFTER THE % SIGN OR BEFORE IT ,
 _ _ UNDERSCORE REPRESENT ONE AND EXACTLY ONE CHARACTER )

Some examples :

'abc' LIKE 'abc'  true 

'abc' LIKE 'a%'  true 

'abc' LIKE '_b_'  true 

'abc' LIKE 'c'  false  

ILIKE is not case sensitive 

 using them :

this will give me ids 1,5,9 with respective titles

 SELECT id ,title FROM books WHERE id IN (1,5,9);


this gives me all id except 1,5,9

 SELECT id ,title FROM books WHERE id NOT IN (1,5,9);


 this gives me all id betwwen 20 and 25 

SELECT id , title FROM books WHERE id BETWEEN 20 AND 25 ;


this will will give me all titles that start with T 

SELECT id,title FROM books WHERE title LIKE 'T%'

this will give me all author with 3 names 

SELECT author FROM books WHERE author ILIKE '% % %';
