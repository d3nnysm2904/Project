installing postgres database:

sude apt-get install postgresql

-------------------
to check if is running we use this command:

sudo service postgresql status 
-------------------
to start it:

sudo service postgresql  start 

to stop it 

sudo service postgresql  stop

----------------------------
 next we need to run this command , this is going to create a user a postgres user specifically with our username:

 sudo -u postgres createuser -s $(whoami); createdb $(whoami) 

 --------
this tells u the username ()

 whoami 

-----
this open the psotgres shell 

psql

to get out of it :

\q 

or 
ctrl+d
----- 
to create a database we use a command :

createdb database_name 

this is inisde terminal not psql shell 
---------------
when database is created we can run "  psql database_name " and connects to the data base    
---------

selects information in the database

SELECT * FROM name_in_database 
---------

seeding a database :
sometimes we have some data we want to initialize  
you can feed .sql scripts into the program psql 
creating the data base from a file .psql 

psql < my_database.sql 

----------------------------------------
Common Commands 

\l - list all databases 

\c db_name - connect to db_name 

\dt -list all tables (in current db)

\d table_name -gets details about table_name (in current db )

\q -quit psql (also ctrl+d )

\x -changes the display of the table to be better read 
---------------------------------------

Delete database 

dropdb my_database_name 

-----------------------------
you can also make a backup of your database by "dumping it" to a file :

--pg_dump -C -c -0 my_database_name > backup.sql--

this makes a file in the current directory (backup.sql)
it contains all of the commands neccesary to recreate the current database when seeding 







What is CRUD: 

letter     verb         Sql commands
-------------------------------------------
  C       Create          INSERT INTO 
-------------------------------------------
  R       Read            SELECT ... FROM 
-------------------------------------------
  U       Update          UPDATE ...SET 
-------------------------------------------
  D       Delete          DELETE FROM 


---------------------------------------------
Determine wich table to use to get data 
opens all info from the db table 

SELECT * FROM table_name_db; 

---------------------------------------------

this gives me only all titles from db choosed  

SELECT titles FROM table_name; 

---------------------------------------------

this give me titles and author

SELECT titles, author FROM table_name;

---------------------------------------------

WHERE (filter wich rows get included )
In this case only books with price over $10 ()

SELECT * FROM books WHERE price > 10;




-----------------------------
selects the titles and the page_count that are less than 800 and bigger than 700 

SELECT title , page_count FROM books WHERE page_count >= 700 AND page_count <=800;
-------------------------------------------

if we want to retrieve some information and put a name to that info we use aliases   AS 

SELECT AVG(page_count) AS avg_pages,AVG(price) AS avg_prices FROM books GROUP BY author ;
