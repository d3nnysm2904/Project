The JOIN operation allows us to create a table in memory by combining information from different tables 
Data from tables is matched according to a join condition 
Most commonly , the join condition involves comparing a foreing key from one table and a primary key in another table  

Types of Joins

Inner 
 only the rows that match the condition in both tables 



----------------------------------------------------------------
joinig both tables in memory 

title is from movies tables and name is from studios table 

 we are going to join studio_id on movies with the id of studios ,reference it 

SELECT title,name
 FROM movies 
 JOIN studios 
 ON movies.studio_id=studios.id;





 if i wanted to select both id from movies and studio 

 SELECT movies.id, studios.id FROM movies JOIN studios ON movies.studio_id = studios.id 
--------------------------------------------------------------
  INNER JOINS 

  JOIN and INNER JOIN are the same , the INNER keyword is optional 

  SELECT title, name
  FROM movies 
  INNER JOIN studios
  ON movie.studio_id= studios.id  

-------------------------------------------------
  OUTER JOIN 
  
 Outer 
 left -All of the rows from the first table (left) combined with matching rows from the second table 
 
 rigth -The matching rows from the first table , combined with all  the rows from the second table 

 full-All the  rows from both tables (left and rigth )

 ---------------------------------------------------------------

  this selects all information from the left side of table movies and added to our new in memory table ,but the rigth table wich is studios is not gonna have all the  info ,only info that is relateded tot he movies tables 

  SELECT title ,name AS studio_name FROM movies LEFT JOIN studios ON movies.studio_id = studios.id;
