\dt to see all 

One to Many relationship 

adding an studio name  to the studio table 

INSERT INTO studios (name ,founded_in)VALUES ('Orion Pictures','1980-10-10')


then inserting a new movie 

INSERT INTO movies (title,release_year,runtime,rating,studio_id)VALUES
('Amadeus','1984',180,'R',4);


now delete 
we can't do this because the studios tables has a foreing key that is linked to movies and is used aas reference 

DELETE FROM studios WHERE id =1

option 1 :
Clear out the studio_id columns of movie that reference it 

UPDATE movies SET studio_id= NULL WHERE studio_id=1;
DELETE FROM studios WHERE id =1 ;


option 2 :
delete the movies aassociated with the studio first 

DELETE FROM movies WHERE studio_id=1;
DELETE FROM studios WHERE id =1;
