Constrains are a basic form of validation. The database can prevent basic types of unintended behavior :

 Primary key (every  table must have a unique identifier )

 Unique (prevent duplicates in the column )

 Not Null (prevent null (lack of a value ,cant be empty) in the column)

 Check (do a logical condition before inserting /updating )

 Foreign Key (column values must reference values in another table )

 Default values (it set a default variable )

 
 PRIMARY KEY - REFERENCES / FOREIGN KEYS 

 REFERENCES(to set a foreign  key we use REFERENCES, then we cant add subreddit witahout an id from users  )


CREATE TABLE subreddits(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL, 
    name VARCHAR (15) NOT NULL ,
    description TEXT,
    subscribers INTEGER CHECK (subscribers > 0) DEFAULT 1, 
    is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT false 
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY  KEY ,
    phone_number TEXT UNIQUE,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    account_balance FLOAT CHECK (account_balance > 0)
 );


DELETION behavior

i can't delete this because the subreddits user_id is reference to users (id)

DELETE FROM users WHERE id=2 ;

so we add :
ON DELETE SET NULL 
if we do this and we have NOT NULL as a constraint , the delete will be attempted, the user will be deleted but then this ON DELETE SET NULL will kick in and it will attempt to set user_id to null so we need to remove NOT NULL 


the second option to delete is adding ON DELETE CASCADE this will cause the reference row to also be deleted 

check the reddit.pgsql to see all 


-- DELETE FROM users WHERE id=2; 
-- this removes all comments where id =2 because of ON DELETE SET NULL 



ALTER TABLE (allow us to add column, remove column, rename column; add and remove and change constraints )


Adding /Removing /Renaming columns 

ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN in_paperback BOOLEAN;

ALTER TABLE books DROP COLUMN in_paperback;

ALTER TABLE books RENAME COLUMN page_count TO num_pages;
