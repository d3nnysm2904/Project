 Writing integration test
  you write with "unittest"  framework  



to do this testing we dont need to start a server, we can do it from the app.py ,flask comes with a particular method called "test_client"
"test_client' is goint to make us a testing client, like a version of  server as long as we call test_client


in testing.py inside of demo folderr 

from app import app  #is like from app.py import app=Flask(_name_)
 (importing the "app=Flask(_name_)" that we are testing from the app.py)

class ColorViewsTestCase(TestCase):
  """ examples of integration test:testing Flask app"""

  def test_color_form(self):
    with app.test_client()as client :
    #sending a get request 
    #making a request to '/'
            res = client.get('/')
            #  this gives us whatever data is being received in this case html data
            html = res.get_data(as_text=True)

            # making sure our get request(res) is 200 code (ok)
            self.assertEqual(res.status_code, 200)

            # is this inside our html variable ,
            self.assertIn('<h1>Color Form</h1>', html)
