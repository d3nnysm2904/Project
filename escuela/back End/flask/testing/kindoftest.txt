Unit Test 
    :does the individual component work ; test individual single components ,test one small piece of the app at a time like a single function 
    testing code in isolated small pieces 
    doesnt test integration of components
    Promote modular code 
        write code with testing in mind 


Unit testing:
    the first is using something thats built into python , is a assesment called 'assert' 
    exmple:

*

def adder(x,y):
        return x+y 
    
assert adder(1,1)==2, '1 +1 is not 2' 

when assert find a error it will stop the code 


python -o app.py 
this will stop assert functionality 
 *

-----------------------------------
DocTest are inside """ """ it tell u what the function does and can be tested from python terminal , comes with python 


def mult(x, y):
    """ Multiply numbers
    >>> mult (3,4)
    12
    >>> mult(2,2)
    4
    """
    return x*y
to run :
 python -m doctest -v aritmetic.py(name of file)




----------------------------------------------------




End-to-end Test:
    You're testing the entire process, The entire application is tested in a real world scenario :
