the past code we done the URL route are been hardcoded , if we wanted to add a route for a specific user in our aplication , we dont want to add every single username as a posible route 
what we can do is add a path  like /user and and then all users are goin to be directed to that route syntax goes like this 
we wrap the variable 'username' inside '<>' in the path and that turn it into a variable
 
USERS={
    "whiskey":"WHISkey the dog",
    "spike":"Spike the pig"
}

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    """show user profile"""
    name= USERS[username]
    return f"<h1> Profile for {name}</h1>


we can have more than one route 

@app.route("/products/<category>/<int:product_id>")
def product_detail(category,product_id):
"""Show details page for product"""



URL parameter 
/shop/<toys>
"feels more like 'subject of page'


QUERY parameter 
/shop?toy=elmo
"feels more like 'extra info abbout page' often used coming from form 


basically URL is for the subject of the page 
query strings are for modifiers or additional info
