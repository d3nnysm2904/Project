the past code we done the URL route are been hardcoded , if we wanted to add a route for a specific user in our aplication , we dont want to add every single username as a posible route 
what we can do is add a path  like /user and and then all users are goin to be directed to that route syntax goes like this 
we wrap the variable 'username' inside '<>' in the path and that turn it into a variable
 
USERS={
    "whiskey":"WHISkey the dog",
    "spike":"Spike the pig"
}

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    """show user profile"""
    name= USERS[username]
    return f"<h1> Profile for {name}</h1>
