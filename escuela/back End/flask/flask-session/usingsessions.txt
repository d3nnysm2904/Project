Refer to demo code flask-session to see examples 

import session from flask

set a secret key 


from flask import session 

app=Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"]= "SHHHH SEEKRIT"


TO use it 
in routes you can read session as a dictionary 

@app.route ('/some-route')
def some_route():
""" Set fav_number in sessions , username and leaderboard"""
    session['fav_number']= 4
    session['username']= 'denny'
    session['leaderboard']=['butters','kratos','luffy']
    
   # return f"Favorite number is {session['fav_number']}"
    return render_template('index.html')


Once the request is made we can eliminate 
 session['username']= 'denny'
 session['leaderboard']=['butters','kratos','luffy']

 but if we ask in the function :
 print(session['username']) 
 we will be able to see the username because once it was send its stored with flask session 

 we dont need to return variables using render_template, because when we use session we have acces to the magical  dictionary inside our jinja templates
