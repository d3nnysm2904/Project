returning json 

from flask import jsonify

JSON is just a string -so you dint need to do anything especial 

@app.route('/movies/json)
def get_json_movies():
    return '{"Boyhood:{"year":2015}}'


most of the times if not always we will not respond with a string 
two considerations 
its finicky to hand-write JSON and get it rigth 
its sometimes helpful to send header to browser that "this is JSON"
 some ajax plugins are better than others in guessing in absence of this 

 @app.route('/movies/json')
 def get_json_movies():
    info={"name": "whiskey","cute":"Hella"}
    return jsonify(info)
#alternate syntax 
return jsonify(name: "whiskey",cute:"Hella")
