To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.



In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic. Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible.

To make headers(h1,h2 ...) in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).


All right!

It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.

You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words. In the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book:

#### Colombian Symbolism in _One Hundred Years of Solitude_

Here's some words about the book _One Hundred Years..._.



Links
We'll now learn how to make links to other web sites on the world wide web.

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

[Search for it.](www.google.com)   -  Search for it.


The other link type is called a reference link. As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an example of what we mean:

     Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com


     Images
If you know how to create links in Markdown, you can create images, too. The syntax is nearly the same.

Images also have two styles, just like links, and both of them render the exact same way. The difference between links and images is that images are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ).

The first image style is called an inline image link. To create an inline image link, enter an exclamation point ( ! ), wrap the alt text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrap the link in parenthesis ( ( ) ). (Alt text is a phrase or sentence that describes the image for the visually impaired.)

For example, to create an inline image link to https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png, with an alt text that says, Benjamin Bannekat, you'd write this in Markdown: ![Benjamin Bannekat](https://octodex.github.com/images/bannekat.png).

another example :
![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

For a reference image, you'll follow the same pattern as a reference link. You'll precede the Markdown with an exclamation point, then provide two brackets for the alt text, and then two more for the image tag, like this: ![The founding father][Father] At the bottom of your Markdown page, you'll define an image for the tag, like this: [Father]: http://octodex.github.com/images/founding-father.jpg.

two more examples :

![Black cat][Black]

![Orange cat][Orange]

[Black]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/81_INF_DIV_SSI.jpg

Blockquotes
If you need to call special attention to a quote from another source, or design a pull quote for a magazine article, then Markdown's blockquote syntax will be useful. A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. For example:

"The sin of doing nothing is the deadliest of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."

To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>). For example:

> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in his pockets and his
  canvas shoes dangling by their knotted laces over his shoulders and, picking a
  pointed salt-eaten stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
  the slope of the breakwater."


  You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is particularly useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs. For example:

> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken
of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some
moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own
loneliness which he feared.
>
> —Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
>
> Cranly did not answer.



Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images, or links.

Lists
This tutorial is all about creating lists in Markdown.

There are two types of lists in the known universe: unordered and ordered. That's a fancy way of saying that there are lists with bullet points, and lists with numbers.

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter
This Markdown list would render into the following bullet points:

Milk
Eggs
Salmon
Butter


An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks. Take a look at this recipe:

Crack three eggs over a bowl
Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

To write that in Markdown, you'd do this:

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

You can choose to add italics, bold, or links within lists, as you might expect.


Occasionally, you might find the need to make a list with more depth, or, to nest one list within another. Have no fear, because the Markdown syntax is exactly the same. All you have to do is to remember to indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.

For example, in the following list, we're going to add some sub-lists to each "main" list item, describing the people in detail:

* Tintin
 * A reporter
 * Has poofy orange hair
 * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
 * A sea captain
 * Has a fantastic beard
 * Loves whiskey
   * Possibly also scotch?
When rendered, this list turns into the following grouping:

Tintin
A reporter
Has poofy orange hair
Friends with the world's most awesome dog
Haddock
A sea captain
Has a fantastic beard
Loves whiskey
Possibly also scotch?

Paragraphs
Markdown has several ways of formatting paragraphs.

Let's take a few lines of poetry as an example. Suppose you want to write text that looks like this:

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)


If you forcefully insert a new line, you end up breaking the togetherness:

Do I contradict myself?

Very well then I contradict myself,

(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
This is what's known as a hard break; what our poetry asks for is a soft break. You can accomplish this by inserting two spaces after each new line. This is not possible to see, since spaces are invisible, but it'd look something like this:

Do I contradict myself?··
Very well then I contradict myself,··
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
