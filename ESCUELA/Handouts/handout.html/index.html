    Intro to HTML
    Hyper Text Markup Language
    
    It’s the language that forms the text or content on a web page
    It consists of predefined elements that add meaning or appearance
    What Does HTML Look Like?
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hi World!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
     
    html, body, and h1 are elements
    They are made up of start tags and end tags
    <html>…</html> goes around entire page
    <body>…</body> goes around visual body
    Which, in this example, is the entire page
    <h1>…</h1> contains a “heading”
    That makes text inside it larger and bold
    Viewing Our HTML
    first.html
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hi World!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
     
    In VSCode, create new file, first.html
    
    HTML pages use extension of .html
    
    Save somewhere convenient, like Desktop
    
    Double-click on first.html
    
    Common HTML Elements
    first.html
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hi World!</h1>
        <p>
          This is
          <b>bold</b> and
          <i>italic</i>
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>
     
    p goes around a paragraph
    b goes around bold text
    i goes around italic text
    Nesting HTML Elements
    first.html
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hi World!</h1>
        <p>
          This is
          <b>bold</b> and
          <i>italic</i>
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>
     
    Elements are often nested inside other elements
    html is the parent of body
    body is a child of html
    b and i are both children of p
    HTML Has Hierarchy
    
    Some Elements Are Required
    To be valid in browsers, there are some tags that are always required:
    
    html (wraps around entire page)
    head (info about page, but isn’t part of visual content)
    title (title of page; goes inside of head)
    body (wraps around visual content of page)
    Plus, at very top, you need a declaration of <!doctype html>
    
    Complete Example:
    
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Second Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My Second Example</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    (Note that doctype starts with ! and has no closing tag)
    
    HTML Mostly Ignores Spaces/Linebreaks
    HTML mostly ignores spaces and linebreaks (we’ll clarify this later)
    
    Tidy, with indentation:
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Second Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My Second Example</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
     
    Messy, all jammed together
    <!doctype html>
    <html><head><title>My Second Page</title>
    </head><body>
    <h1>My
    Second Example</h1>
    </body></html>
    Paragraphs, Headings, and Breaks
    Paragraphs
    HTML is often used to present largely-textual information.
    
    It’s common for text to appear inside a paragraph:
    
    <p>It was a dark and stormy night.</p>
    It’s possible for other tags to go inside a p tag, but a paragraph cannot contain another paragraph.
    
    Headers
    There are different heading elements you can use, from largest/most-important, to smallest/least-important:
    
    h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest)
    
    You’ll often use several of these, in order
    
    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Section text here...</p>
    
    <h3>Sub-section header</h3>
    <p>Sub-section text here...</p>
    
    <h3>Another sub-section</h3>
    ...
    
    <h2>Another Section</h2>
    Breaks
    There are two common kinds of breaks
    
    <br>
    Breaks a line in the middle of the line
    
    <p>Hi<br>World</p> breaks this into two Linebreaks
    
    <hr>
    Draws a line across the screen
    
    <p>Hi<hr>World</p> breaks this into two lines, with line drawn between
    
    Note that both of these elements only have a start tag — they don’t have an end tag after them.
    
    Lists in HTML
    HTML can make two kinds of lists:
    
    unordered (bulleted, typically)
    ordered (numbered, typically)
    Unordered Lists
    A sequence of list items surrounded by an unordered list element:
    
    <ul>
      <li>apple</li>
      <li>berry</li>
      <li>cherry</li>
    </ul>
     
    apple
    berry
    cherry
    The list should only directly contain list items — but list items can contain text and other elements.
    
    Ordered Lists
    A sequence of list items surrounded by an ordered list element:
    
    <ol>
      <li>first</li>
      <li>second</li>
      <li>third</li>
    </ol>
     
    first
    second
    third
    The list should only directly contain list items — but list items can contain text and other elements.
    
    Text Modifications
    HTML intentionally doesn’t have many elements to change appearance — that is more the domain of CSS
    
    We’ll cover some basic parts of HTML that do focus on appearance
    
    Bold and Italics
    <b>...</b> or <strong>...</strong>
    This is bold
    <i>...</i> or <em>...</em>
    This is italics
    Smaller Text
    <small>...</small>
    Smaller than normal text
    Superscript / Subscript
    <sup>...</sup>
    This is most useful for math or footnotes: x2
    <sub>...</sub>
    This is most useful for math or chemistry: H2O
    Blockquotes
    <blockquote>...</blockquote>
    Quoted text that can stand on its own:
    
    To be or not to be That is the question
    Links
    HTML pages are often linked together:
    
    a page of yours can point to another page of yours
    a page of yours can point to any other site on the Internet
    Link Tag
    To link to a page of yours:
    
    <a href="another.html">Visit here!</a>
    That shows the text “Visit here!” and makes it a link to “another.html”, which is a file in the same folder as this page.
    
    Attributes
    That’s our first example of an attribute, which can be a part of a tag.
    
    Attributes provide other info to a tag, such as:
    
    Changing the appearance of the element
    Showing links what they link to
    Telling image tags where the image file can be found
    Attributes are always a word, followed by an equal sign, and a value (typically in quotes, like our example)
    
    Where To Link
    You can also link to pages deeper down at your site:
    
    <a href="employees/elmo.html">About Elmo</a>
    This links to the page “elmo.html” in the “employees” directory in this folder
    
    You can also link to pages higher up at your site:
    
    <a href="../another.html">Another Page</a>
    This links to a page one folder up than the current folder.
    
    You can also link to other sites:
    
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_loris">Adorable!</a>
    This links directly to a page on Wikipedia.
    
    To link to another site, your href attribute needs to have a complete URL — typically starting with “http://” or “https://”
    
    Images
    HTML can show images, either from your site or another site:
    
    <img src="https://photo.jpg">
     https://tinyurl.com/y39p455z
    This is another tag with an “attribute” — src is the location of the actual image file.
    
    You can link to images on your site or other sites:
    
    <img src="photo.jpg">
    
    <img src="../photo.jpg">
    
    <img src="employees/elmo.jpg">
    
    <img src="https://tinyurl.com/y39p455z">
    Sizing Images
    Until told otherwise, browsers show images at their real size.
    
    You can use height and width attributes to set the size of an image:
    
    <img src="photo.jpg" width="200" height="100">
    That makes the image 200 pixels wide and 100 pixel high, regardless of normal size
    
    It’s often better to do this in an editing program, or use CSS for this.
    
    Image Types
    Web browsers can show every type of image, but common types:
    
    GIF
    JPG
    PNG
    You can export into one of these types in most image-designing programs
    
    Entities
    HTML is meant to be text, and it can be tricky to get special symbols, like copyright symbols or curly quotes, into HTML
    
    HTML can have entities which are text spellings for common symbols.
    
    Entities are always an ampersand, a single word, and a semicolon:
    
    &example;
    Less Than / Greater Than
    Since HTML tags use angle brackets, if you try to use these symbols in your HTML, it will often confuse browsers.
    
    Instead use:
    
    &lt;
    Turns into a “less-than” symbol: <
    &gt;
    Turns into a “greater-than” symbol: >
    Copyright Symbol
    &copy;
    Turns into a “copyright” symbol: ©
    Curly Quotes
    You can put “straight quotes” directly into HTML: She said "Hello"
    
    Curly quotes can be trickier, and are often done with entities:
    
    &ldquo;
    Turns into a “left-double-quote”: “
    &rdquo;
    Turns into a “right-double-quote”: ”
    To write a pretty quote:
    
    She said: &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
    Emmet
    Emmet is a library for writing html with fewer keystrokes
    We will be covering how to generate html quickly with Emmet shortcuts
    
    Try it out
    Emmet comes pre-installed with VScode Create a new file with a .html extension
    
    Type ! and pres tab You should see some automatically generated html like the following:
    
    // index.html
    
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    Creating elements with Emmet
    A pain point when writing html tags is typing the opening and closing brackets With Emmet we just need to specify the tag type and press tab
    
    
    h1 tab
     
    <h1></h1>
    
    div tab
     
    <div></div>
    Nested elements
    It is also possible to create elements inside of elements
    
    
    div>p tab
     
    <div>
        <p></p>
    </div>
    
    div>ul>li tab
     
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    Creating multiple elements
    To create multiple elements use * and the number of elements you want
    
    
    div*3 tab
     
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    This is especially useful for list items
    
    
    ul>li*4 tab
     
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    Adding text inside of elements
    Place the text inside of curly braces following the tag type
    
    
    div{hi} tab
     
    <div>hi</div>
    
    p>div{inner}*2 tab
     
    <p>
        <div>inner</div>
        <div>inner</div>
    </p>
    Creating sibling elements
    Sibling elements are separated by +
    
    
    div+p tab
     
    <div></div>
    <p></p>
    
    div+ul>li+li+li tab
     
    <div></div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
    div+ul>li*3 tab
    (a better way)
     
    <div></div>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    Creating elements with attributes
    You can specify any attribute type inside square brackets
    
    
    div[class=’class1’]*2 tab
     
    <div class="class1"></div>
    <div class="class1"></div>
    
    div>p[class=’style1’]{text}*3 tab
     
    <div>
        <p class="style1">text</p>
        <p class="style1">text</p>
        <p class="style1">text</p>
    </div>
