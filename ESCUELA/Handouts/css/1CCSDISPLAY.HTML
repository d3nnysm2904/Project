Goals
Compare different values for the display property
Compare different values for the position property
Provide an overview of responsive design and CSS transitions
Highlight features of production-level CSS
Display
“How should this be displayed?”

inline (e.g. <i>, <image>, <span>)
Only takes as much space as needed
ignores width and height properties
Next inline item is side-by-side
block (e.g. <form>, <div>, <section>)
100% of parent width unless set via width or max-width
can modify width and height with CSS
Next item is on a separate line
inline-block
Side-by-side, like inline
Respects width and height, like block
Feature	block	inline	inline-block
Side-by-side layout	❌	✅	✅
Respects width / height properties	✅	❌	✅
none
Don’t show, don’t take up any space
flex
Enables Flexbox (see below).
Plus lots of specific ones related to lists, tables, and so on

Flexbox
Flexbox is a large topic, beyond the scope of a single lecture.

TL;DR: flexbox makes common layouts easier to create

Common Flexbox Properties
On an element with display set to flex:

justify-content: along main axis

_images/justify-content.svg
 
align-items: along cross axis

_images/align-items.svg

Flexbox Defense

Position
“How should this be positioned?”

static
Default until you say otherwise
Appears at normal place in “flow”
“Positioned”
All non-static are considered “positioned”
relative
relative to normal position (via top, right, bottom, left)
takes same space as if it were static & in normal flow
absolute
absolute position from closest positioned ancestor
other relative settings, like width, come from that now, too
removed from flow, takes up no space
fixed
absolutely positioned from viewport (stays there on scroll)
removed from flow, takes up no space
Other Position Values

There are many other possibilities here, but many are uncommon to work with.

Two additional useful ones are:

sticky
A combination of absolute and fixed; this is useful for allowing something to scroll on the screen, but then fix to the viewport before it scrolls out of sight.
Responsive Design
Bad old days: separate sites for desktop & mobile
Semi-bad semi-old days: every site should have a native app
Responsive design: same site with adjustments in CSS
Media Queries
/* default to smaller devices ("mobile-first") */

img.headshot {
  display: block;
  width: 70%;
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  img.headshot {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 10em;
  }

  /* other "desktop-size" stuff here...*/
}
Mostly, we’ll use Bootstrap for this

Transitions
transition: property duration function delay [, …]

What property changes? (all for all)
Over what time (eg, 3s)
What function determines values? (ease, linear)
What delay before this? (eg, 0.5s)
Can list several properties
Transition Intro

Professional CSS
Industry practice varies here!

Common ideas:

avoid !important where reasonable
generally, prefer classes over IDs (IDs for JS is fine!)
“why” comments in CSS can be even more important
adopt & use a naming scheme
Class Naming Conventions
CSS about a “component” is named (via class) after component:

.Tweet { /* ...declarations go here ... */ }
Variations/small subcomponents get “dashed” name:

.Tweet-likes { /* stuff about the photo ... */ }
Used-lots-of-places “utilities” get lowercase classes:

.muted {
  font-size: 80%;
  color: gray;
}
This is a light version of style called BEM

“Meta-CSS” Systems
There are meta-systems for CSS, doing things like:

Letting you associate colors with names (eg, “our logo color”)
Factor out common CSS declarations
Calculate things (“our logo color, but 10% darker”)
Common systems are: SASS and LESS
