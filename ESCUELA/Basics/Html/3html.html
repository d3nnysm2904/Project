    <b><b>Advanced Form Inputs</b></b>
    There are additional types of form fields that don’t use the input element:

drop down menus
larger text blocks
submission of files
<b>Drop Down Menus</b>
Drop down menus (where you can pick exactly one choice) use select and option elements:
Pick an animal:
<select name="animal">
  <option value="cat">Cat</option>
  <option value="dog">Dog</option>
  <option value="porcupine">Porcupine</option>
</select>That results in a drop-down menu with options of cat/dog/porcupine.

It starts with “cat” selected — if you want to start with an empty choice, add an option with value of "", and add some text like “Select choice”

<b>Larger Text Areas</b>
The input type of text accepts one line of text.

If you want larger text fields that can also include linebreaks, use textarea instead:
<textarea name="biography"></textarea>
Notice that this has a starting and ending tag.

This allows you to enter default text (for example, a generic bio)

You can set height/width of box with rows and cols attributes:
<textarea name="biography" rows="10" cols="40"></textarea>

<b>File Submission</b>
File submission requires that your server is set up to receive the file.

It requires you to change the form tag and have an input type of file:
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    Choose file to upload:
    <input type="file" name="my-file">
    <button type="submit">Upload File</button>
  </form>
  This submits the form in a special way so that it includes the file data.
