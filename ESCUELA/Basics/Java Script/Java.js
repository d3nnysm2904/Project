Variables : we can store a value and give it a name, so that we can 
recall it 
use it 
or change it later on
basic syntax:
let year= 365 

let hens = 4;
let rooster = 2;
hens=rooster//6 /this is saving a value 
---------------------------------
let hens=4
//now there is only 3 
hens-1//this is not changing the value 
hens;//still 4
hens=hens-1//this does 
hens//3
another way to change it 
hen=7
hen//7 
or 
hen+=4//equals  11  ;we can do it with all operations 
//another examples 
let score =10;
let bonusMult=10
score*=bonusMult//equals 100 
-----------------------------
let counter = 1
counter++//equals 2

Let is an option for making a variable 
there is one other option 
a keyword called const stand for constant 
examle const year =365 but you cannot change the value of thee variable
