   <h1>What is the DOM</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Document Object Model </li>
        <li>It is the programming interface for HTMl</li>
        <li >A representation of our HtmL that can be used using JavaScript </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How does it get created ?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When a web page is loaded , the browser creates the DOM for that specific page</li>
        <li>This allows for the creation of dynamic web pages where users can interact with the page</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The DOM under the hood  </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The structure of the DOM uses something called a tree, where the topmost node is the <b>document</b>object </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Concluison of the DOM</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The Dom is an object representation,literal JAvScript content that are representing content on the web page and how they are related to one another  </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Using the document object </h1>

    <h2>What can we do with document object </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding elements </li>
        <ul>
            <li><h6>getElementById</h6></li>
            getElementById accepts a string wich is the name of an <b>id</b>in the DOM.It finds the first matching id 
            <li> <b>document.getElemntById('main');</b> </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Msaking new elements</li>
        <li>Updating elements/li>
        <li>Changing properties of elements </li>
        <li>Listening for events like click</li>
    </ul>


    <P>console.dir(document) to acces DOCUMENT in console </P>
<p>document.getElementById('gallery');
    <br> this retrieve an htm element <br>
    <div></div>
    
  <h3>Selecting elements by id name </h3>
  <b>  document.getElementById('muffin-form');</b>
<br>this select an html elment based on id </p>


<h3>Selecting elments by tag name (h1,p,li,inputs,etc)</h3>
<b>document.getElementsByTagName('li')</b>
<ul>
    <li>getElementsByTagName accepts a string which is the name of an element in the DOM </li>
    <li>Allows to selecet all h1 ,images, anchor tags, etc </li>
<h3>what we get back</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It returns an HTMLCollection to us
        <br>
    it looks like an array , and u can acces it at specific index or use a foor loop </li>
</ul>
</ul>

 c

<h3>Selecting element by class name </h3>
<b>Syntax:document.getElementsByClassName('classname' )</b>
<ul>
    <li>getElementsByCLassName accepts a string wich is the name of an element in the DOM</li>
    <li>All elments that have the same class will be retrieved and store in a HtmlColection</li>
</ul>
<b>How to select 2 or more classes </b>
<p>by seperating them with space </p>
<h6>Two classes</h6>
<ul>
    <li>section-title </li>
    <li>country</li>
</ul>

<b>document.getElementsByClassNAme('section-title country')</b>
    <br>

<h1>innerText</h1>

<p>To acces the h1 in HTML we create an variable like {const = document.querySelector('h1')} then (h1.innerText)// wil be 'What is the DOM'   </p>

<p>if we want to change text (h1.innerText= 'Go Away')</p>
<p>innerTExt will give u all the text even if is nested inside another element like (i)  > </p>
   

<h1>textConten</h1>

<p>SAMe as innerText but the difference is that it retrieves all the data as text </p>
<p> other acction  is that  hide content withint the html form is showed.</p>
<h4 style="display: none;">Lirics </h4>

<h1>innerHTML</h1>

          <p><i class="latin">Sequoiadendron giganteum</i> (giant sequoia; also known as giant redwood, Sierra redwood,
            Sierran redwood,
            Wellingtonia or simply big tree—a nickname also used by John Muir<sup>[2]</sup>) is the sole living species in the
            genus Sequoiadendron, and one of three species of coniferous trees known as redwoods.</p>
      
          <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
          <hr>
      
          <p>Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world. They grow to an average height of
            50–85
            m (164–279 ft) with trunk diameters ranging from 6–8 m (20–26 ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8 m (311
            ft) tall. The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8 m
            (28.9
            ft)</p>
      
          <p>The oldest known giant sequoia is 3,500 years old based on dendrochronology. Giant sequoias are among the oldest
            living organisms on Earth. Giant sequoia bark is fibrous, furrowed, and may be 90 cm (3 ft) thick at the base of
            the
            columnar trunk. The bark provides significant protection from fire damage. The leaves are evergreen, awl-shaped,
            3–6
            mm (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> – <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> in) long, and arranged spirally on the shoots.</p>
      
          <p>John Muir wrote of the species in about 1870:</p>
      
          <blockquote>"Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia! Behold! Behold! seems all I can say. Some time ago I
            left
            all for Sequoia and have been and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light
            in
            the woods, in the world? Where are such columns of sunshine, tangible, accessible, terrestrialized?'"</blockquote>
      
          <h2 class="section-title">Biology</h2>
          <hr>
      
          <p>Because of its size, the tree has been studied for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a
            few
            meters by osmotic pressure but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching capillarity (capillary
            action) in the tree's xylem (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the
            leaves.<sup>[10]</sup> Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through air roots, at heights to
            where the root water cannot be pulled</p>
      
          <h2 class="section-title">Cultivation</h2>
          <hr>
      
          <p>Giant sequoia is a very popular ornamental tree in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and
            southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America north to southwest British Columbia, the southern United
            States, southeast Australia, New Zealand and central-southern Chile. It is also grown, though less successfully,
            in
            parts of eastern North America.</p>
      
          <h3 class="section-title country">United States and Canada</h3>
      
          <p>Giant sequoias are grown successfully in the Pacific Northwest and southern US, and less successfully in eastern
            North America. Giant sequoia cultivation is very successful in the Pacific Northwest from western Oregon north to
            southwest British Columbia, with fast growth rates. In Washington and Oregon, it is common to find giant sequoias
            that have been successfully planted in both urban and rural areas. In the Seattle area, large specimens exceeding
            90
            ft (27 m) are fairly common and exist in several city parks and many private yards (especially east Seattle
            including Capitol Hill, Washington Park, & Leschi/Madrona, as well as Tacoma's Jefferson Park).</p>
      
          <h3 class="section-title country">New Zealand</h3>
      
          <p>Several impressive specimens of Sequoiadendron giganteum can be found in the South Island of New Zealand. Notable
            examples include a set of trees in a public park of Picton, as well as robust specimens in the public and
            botanical
            parks of Christchurch and Queenstown There are also several in private gardens in Wanaka. There is also a tree at
            Rangiora High School, which was planted for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and is thus over 125 years old</p>
