Goals
Understand what reduce does
Use reduce to create new data structures
reduce
Whatever is returned from the callback function, becomes the new value of the accumulator!

Accepts a callback function and an optional second parameter
Iterates through an array
Runs a callback on each value in the array
The first parameter to the callback is either the first value in the array or the optional second parameter
The first parameter to the callback is often called “accumulator”
The returned value from the callback becomes the new value of accumulator
Let’s Break It Down
let evens = [2,4,6,8,10];

evens.reduce(function(accumulator, nextValue){
  return accumulator + nextValue;
});

/*
  2
  6
  12
  20
  30
*/
Adding A Second Parameter
let evens = [2,4,6,8,10];

evens.reduce(function(accumulator, nextValue){
  return accumulator + nextValue;
},10);

/*
  12
  16
  22
  30
  40
*/
Let’s Try Something Else
let names = ['Maya', 'Tammy', 'Angela', 'Alexis'];

names.reduce(function(accumulator, nextValue){
  if(nextValue !== "Colt"){
    return accumulator += ' ' + nextValue;
  }
  return accumulator;
},'My friends are');

/*
  Here is what reduce will build up:

  'My friends are Maya'
  'My friends are Maya Tammy'
  'My friends are Maya Tammy Angela'

  With a final output of:

  'My friends are Maya Tammy Angela Alexis'
*/
When You Would Use Reduce
It works for almost everything, but is sometimes overkill
When you want to transform an array into another data structure
Recap
reduce returns an accumulated value which is determined by the result of what is returned to each callback
reduce begins with the first value in the array or with an optional second argument for the starting value
