Goals
Explain the basic structure of a conditional statement
Explain how expressions evaluate to either true or false for controlling conditional statements
Construct ternaries and switch statements to control the flow of our programs
Comparison operators
A JavaScript expression can evaluate to either true or false through the use of comparison operators

Comparison operators are useful when comparing multiple values

let userAge = 20;

userAge > 10;      // -> true
userAge <= 20;     // -> true
userAge === 30;    // -> false
A list of comparison operators

=== strict equality
== equality
!== strict inequality
!= not equal
< less than
<= less than or equal to
> greater than
>= greater than or equal to
Be careful when using relational operators (i.e. less than, greater than, etc) on things that aren’t numbers!

== vs ===
Checks for equality of value, but not equality of type.
It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.
This can lead to some unexpected results!
Use === and !==
Conditional statements
In javascript every expression returns a value
All values can be evaluated as true or false
This allows us to control the flow of our programs through conditional statements
We will explore expression as boolean values in detail but first let’s look at conditional statements
What Are Conditional Statements?
When an expression is passed to a conditional statement, the expression is converted to true or false
This allows us to determine if a code branch runs or not
In other words, the code runs only if certain conditions are met
Basic conditional statements
if (true) {
  console.log("This was true")
} else {
  console.log("This was false")
}

// this would print true
if x is true, run the first block of code
else in any other case, run another block of code
We can place any expression in the parentheses and it will be converted to true or false
Why Do We Need Conditionals?
if (true) {
  // print it was true
} else {
  // print it was false
}
In this example we hardcoded true so the first block will always execute
But in programming real applications, it’s all about responding to different user inputs
Typically we won’t know what the value of a variable is going to be and use conditional logic to handle different scenarios
Example :
let inputPassword = 'secret1';

if (secret1 === dbPassword) {
  // authenticate the user

} else {
  // print your password was incorrect

}
User enters password
Does it match the database?
Yes, proceed
No, try again
// let inputPassword = 'secret1';

if (secret1 === databasePassword) {
  // authenticate the user

} else {
  // print your password was incorrect

}
Notice here we used ‘===’ to compare the user input with the stored value in our database
This is our first example of a comparison operator
Comparison operators are one approach for converting an expression to a boolean value
Else if
In addition to ‘if’ and ‘else’ statements
There is a third condition ‘else if’
‘else if’ is unique because it can be used multiple times
if x is true, run the first block of code
else if y is true, run a different block of code
else in any other case, run another block of code
let x = 10;

// only one of the branches below will run

if (x > 10) {
  console.log('x is greater than 10');

} else if (x === 10) {
  console.log('x is equal to 10');

} else {
  console.log('x is less than 10');

}
It is important to note only one code branch will run
let x = 11;

if (x > 10) {
  console.log('x is greater than 10');

} else if (x === 11) {
  console.log('x is equal to 11');

} else {
  console.log('x is less than 10');

}
Even if two conditions are true, only the code in the first true condition runs

Conditional statements
What will this code do?

let x = 11;

if (x > 10) {
  console.log('x is greater than 10');
}

if (x === 11) {
  console.log('x is equal to 11');

} else {
  console.log('x is less than 10');

}
Since there are multiple ‘if’ statements multiple blocks of code can run
If the second ‘if’ condition was replaced with ‘else if’ only the first true statement will run
Boolean expressions
If you’re wondering where the name Boolean comes from, it’s George Boole. He invented Boolean Algebra / Logic which is the basis of modern computing.

Boolean logic is actually simple to understand! It’s just the system of logic governing true or false values and the relationships formed by combining them together into logical expressions.

When we pass an expression to a conditional statement the return value is converted to true or false
This allows us to control the flow of the program
Evaluating expressions as true or false
To understand how expressions become true or false we must know the following concepts

Truthy or falsy values
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Truthy or falsy values
Expressions in the parentheses of a conditional statement resolve to true or false
Values that are not explicitly true or false are still innately evaluated “truthy” or “falsey”.
There are only six falsy values

false
null
undefined
0
‘’
NaN
Everything else evaluates to true

Determining Truthiness
If you are ever unsure if something is truthy or falsey, you can simply convert it to a boolean

One way of doing this by wrapping it in a Boolean constructor
let favoriteNumber = 0;

Boolean('hi');             // true
Boolean('');               // false
Boolean(favoriteNumber);   // false
Boolean(null);             // false
Boolean(1);                // true
Boolean(undefined);        // false
Boolean('cat');            // true
Boolean(-0);               // false
Boolean(-1);               // true
Logical Operators
Logical Operators are the final approach for evaluating expressions as either true or false

There are three essential logical operators in JavaScript:

NOT !
OR ||
AND &&
NOT !
“!” flips the value of the expression

let a = true;

console.log(!a); // => false
You can think of “!a” reading like the following

if (not a) {
  // -> run this code
}
The bang “!” operator can also be used to evaluate an expression as a boolean value
We already saw how we can do this with the Boolean constructor
Boolean('hi');      // true
Another approach is to use use “!!” (bang bang)
let favoriteNumber = 0;

!!'hi';             // true
!!'';               // false
!!favoriteNumber;   // false
!!null;             // false
!!1;                // true
!!undefined;        // false
!!'cat';            // true
This flips the boolean value twice to give the correct “truthy / falsy” value
OR ||
The easiest way to think about ‘||’

If the left value is true or the right value is true the entire expression is true
If both the left value and the right value are false, the entire expression is false
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a || b); // true
console.log(a || a); // true
console.log(b || b); // false
But we should look at this more precisely, the “||” logical operator checks two values
If the value on the left evaluates to true, the left value is returned
The left value then gets converted to a truthy / falsy value
'hi' || 5        // => 'hi' (truthy)

1000 || ''       // => 1000 (truthy)
If the value to the left is false then the value to the right will be returned regardless of its value
'' || 5          // => 5 (truthy)

'' || 0          // => 0 (falsey)
The return value is what ultimately gets converted to a truthy falsy value

The “||” logical operator is often used with conditional statements
'' || 5     // => 5
Since 5 evaluates to true the entire expression evaluates to true
Boolean('' || 5) // => true
if ('' || 5) {
  // this code will execute

} else {
  // this code will not

}
AND &&
The “&&” logical operator also checks two values
With “||” the left side or the right side need to be true to return a truthy value
With “&&” the left side and the right side both need to be true for the expression to return a truthy value
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // false
console.log(a && a); // true
console.log(b && b); // false
Example
if (a && b) {
  // a and b are both true

} else if (!a && b) {
  // a is false but b is true

} else if (a && !b) {
  // a is true but b is false

} else {
  // a is false and b is false

}
Short Circuiting
Note that in an expression with “&&” or “||”, sometimes the right-hand side never actually runs!
Specifically there are two cases where the expression is “short-circuited”:
false expression && anything
(If the left expression is false we immediately move on)
true expression || anything
(If the left expression is true we immediately move on)
2 + 2 === 5 && console.log('this will never run!');

5 > 1 || console.log('this won\'t either!');
Operator Precedence
NOT (!) has higher precedence than && and ||
&& has higher precedence than ||
You can alter this using parenthesis ()
The Ternary Operator
A more advanced application of conditional statements is the ternary operator
A ternary operator is the shorthand for an “if / else” statement
(ternary operators can only have two branches and do not work with “else if”)
The name ternary comes from the fact that there are three operands. An expression followed by two statements
They allow us to write conditionals on one line
( expression to check ) ? statement if true : statement if false
// guess a number between 1 to 20

let guess = 15;

guess > answer ? console.log('too high') : console.log('too low');
Often you will capture the return value of a ternary operator in a variable

let guess = 15;

let wasCorrect = (guess === 15) ? 'Your correct!' : 'Incorrect';

console.log(wasCorrect) // => 'Your correct!'
