Debugging + Errors
Download Demo Code

Goals
Define three of the most common errors in JavaScript and how to debug them
Examine the Chrome Dev Tools for debugging
Catch errors using try/catch/finally blocks
Throw errors with specific messages
Debugging
You are going to make mistakes!
Let’s examine ways to better debug
Let’s first examine some common errors
SyntaxError
You’ve seen this one before!
You have to fix these right away!
"awesome

function first( {}

let = "nice!"
ReferenceError
Thrown when you try to access a variable that is not defined
This does not mean undefined
function sayHi(){
  let greeting = "hi!";
}

sayHi();

greeting;   // ReferenceError
TypeError
Trying to do something with a type that you can not
Accessing properties on undefined or null
Invoking (“calling”) something that is not a function
"awesome".splice() // TypeError

let obj = {}

obj.firstName.moreInfo // TypeError
Two Kinds of Bugs
An error is thrown — easier
You didn’t get what you wanted — harder!
A process for debugging
Make assumptions
Test assumptions
Prove assumptions
Repeat
console.log
Be mindful about what you print out
Great for a sanity check
Even better when you add parameters
console.log("We made it!");

console.log("The value of x is --->", x);
JavaScript Debugger
Watch execution of code and examine at any point
Built into Chrome (other browsers have similiar abilities)
Can debug in-browser code or Node
Starting Debugger
View code or adding “breakpoints”:

View → Developer → Developer Tools → Sources tab

Click left of line of code to add a blue breakpoint

Can put breakpoint into code itself:

function myFunction() {
  let x = 1;

  debugger;   // <-- will always stop here

  // rest of code follows ...
}
Step Over
_images/step-over-outline.svg
Run current line, but don’t debug into any function calls

Step Into
_images/step-into-outline.svg
Run current line, stepping into any function calls

Step Out
_images/step-out-outline.svg
Return from this function to caller

Call Stack
_images/call-stack.svg
Shows stack of function calls that got you here

Scope
_images/scope.svg
Shows current value of variables

Can click to change value

Tips To Avoid Bugs
Plan First
Software and cathedrals are much the same — first we build them, then we pray.

—Sam Redwine, 1988

Keep It Simple
Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place.

If you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?

—Brian Kernighan, The Elements of Programming Style

(That’s a particularly excellent intermediate book, by the way)

Common JavaScript Bugs
== is very loose about comparisons (=== isn’t)
7 == "7"
Objects & arrays are not equal to similar objects & arrays
[1, 2, 3] !== [1, 2, 3]
Calling function with missing arguments makes those arguments undefined
Calling function with extra arguments is ignored (the extra arguments are ignored).
Getting a missing property from object/index from array is undefined
Good News
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.

—Edsger W. Dijkstra

Bugs are an opportunity to improve debugging skills & to learn something
You will have lots of chances to practice this valuable skill!
Error Handling
Sometimes errors can not be avoided!
This especially happens when working with external APIs / other people’s data
Connection failures
The API is down
Instead of errors crashing our program, let’s handle them gracefully!
Let’s “try” it out!
functionThatDoesNotExist();
console.log("did we make it?");
try {
  functionThatDoesNotExist();
} catch (err){
  console.log("something went wrong!", err);
}

console.log("did we make it?");
Notice the important difference here!

Introducing try / catch
try {
  // place the code you would like to try to run
} catch(err){
  // if an error occurs, run whatever code we place in here!
}

// keep going!
try and catch create block scope, so if you define a variable inside using let or const it will only exist in that block.

The parameter to catch is optional, but we highly recommend using it so you can see what the error is and any information about it!

Another example
function displayInitials(user){
  let firstNameLetter = user.firstName[0].toUpperCase();
  let lastNameLetter = user.lastName[0].toUpperCase();
  return `Hello ${firstNameLetter}.${lastNameLetter}`;
}
What happens when we don’t pass in an object?

What happens when our object does not have the correct keys or values?

Using try / catch
function displayInitials(user){
  let firstNameLetter;
  let lastNameLetter;
  try {
    firstNameLetter = user.firstName[0].toUpperCase();
    lastNameLetter = user.lastName[0].toUpperCase();
  } catch(e){
    return "Invalid input!";
  }
  return `Hello ${firstNameLetter}.${lastNameLetter}`;
}
Strive to only place code that will throw an error inside your try/catch block!

When to use try/catch
Think about using try/catch when:

The output of your program is unpredictable
There is any chance that an unexpected error may occur
You don’t want a tremendous amount of conditional logic
Making your own errors!
You can actually create your own errors in JavaScript using the throw keyword

console.log("an error is coming....");
throw "What just happened?!?";
console.log("did we make it?");
Exploring with try/catch
console.log("an error is coming....");

try {
  throw "Oh no!";
} catch (err) {
  console.log("what happened?", err);
}
All we see here is the string that we passed to throw with no information about the kind of error or where it happened.

Throwing better errors
Instead of just using the throw keyword, you can make a new Error object using the new keyword.

console.log("an error is coming....");

try {
  throw new Error("Oh no!");
} catch (err) {
  console.log("what kind of error?", err.name);
  console.log("what is the message?", err.message);
  console.log("where did it happen?", err.stack);
}
Notice that we get more information here including where the error occured!

We’ll discuss what new does in much more detail later in the course, but for now you should use it when making your own errors.

When should you use this?
any time you want to hide errors from a user
any time you want to produce custom errors for your users’ benefit.
it works as a nice fallback in areas of your code that could fail under unusual circumstances that were not foreseen during development
it can hide overly-technical error messages from users who wouldn’t understand them anyhow
use it for portions of your code where you suspect errors will occur that are beyond your control
When should you not use this?
If you know an error is going to occur, because in this case you would want to debug the problem, not hide it.

You still have to debug on your own!

finally
try/catch blocks come with another optional keyword finally which will execute code regardless if an error is thrown or not

try {
  undefined(); // this will throw a TypeError
} catch (err){
  console.log("something went wrong!", err);
} finally {
  console.log("we're all done!");
}
You will rarely find yourself using this, but it’s good to know if you want to be explicit about what to run no matter what in a try/catch block

Recap
A SyntaxError happen when JavaScript is unable to parse certain syntax
A ReferenceError occurs when JavaScript tries to access a variable that is not aware of - remember your scopes!
A TypeError occurs when JavaScript runs an invalid expression on the wrong type
You can throw your own errors using the throw keyword
Using try/catch/finally blocks are an excellent way to handle errors when they may be unpredictable
